### Doing M249 Practical Modern Statistics in Python Style

M249 Practical Modern Statistics is a great statistics course from the Open University.

It contains the following modules:
- Medical Statistics
- Time Series
- Multivariate Analysis
- Bayesian Statistics

The module uses SPSS and Winbugs to teach these different branches of statistics.

This is my attempt of doing these modules  with Python only.

I'm mainly using pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn.

This is based on Python 3 (and a recent version of R)

For now I've "turned off" R in both runtime.txt and requirements.txt to see if the Binder image gets built faster without R.

You can check the notebooks in an interactive environment using Binder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandervandenOord/M249/master?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks
