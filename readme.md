### Doing M249 Practical Modern Statistics in Python Style

M249 Practical Modern Statistics is a great statistics course from the Open University.

It contains the following modules:
- Medical Statistics
- Time Series
- Multivariate Statistics
- Bayesian statistics

It uses SPSS and Winbugs to teach these different branches of statistics.

This is my attempt of doing these modules  with Python only.

I'm mainly using pandas, statsmodels matplotlib, seaborn, sci-kit learn and pymc.
